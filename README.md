  ## Description
  This project is dedicated to a high school chess club. The goal of this prooject is to provide an app where the members of the chess club can track their ranking based on games they play within the chess club meetings. Once they create profiles and add all member to a bracket, they will play games against eachother, and the results will be tracked and added to the app by the head of the chess club. The app will feature a specific ELO algorithm to update their current standings amongst the other members.


  ## Instructions
  This will be added to later.
